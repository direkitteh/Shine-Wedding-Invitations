Familiar concepts:
- Generating elements via Javascript
- Creating helper functions
- Sorting
- Click handling
- Interactions that only count one time
- Setting attributes via Javascript
- Arrays, forEach, and for loops
- Console logging

Unfamiliar concepts:
- Local storage: Apparently it stores everything as Strings instead of the original data type. Pretty straightforward otherwise.
- Converting undefined / null objects to numbers was more difficult than anticipated. I made a helper method to handle that.
- I needed a refresher on JQuery syntax, but the reference guide was sufficient.
- I also needed a refresher on regex syntax in Javascript.

Additional notes:
- I probably could have done this without JQuery. It's just easier to select items with JQuery.
- For some reason, $.create wasn't working for me, so I used document.createElement
- I used the title attribute to indicate the number of times the images had been clicked. The count updates on each click.
- On load, there will be a console log of the last order by clicks followed by the ordered image numbers and their click counts.
  Example:
  Stored order: 4,3,2,5
  4: 2
  3: 2
  2: 2
  5: 2
  7: 2
  0: 1
  1: 1
  6: 1
- In the event of ties for click counts, the images are shown in ascending order.
- Images ordered by click order are always displayed before images ordered by click count.
- Only the first click per load specifies order, but you can click on the images an unlimited number of times for the click count.
- I considered creating an Image class to centralize the handling of clicks and storage, but I felt it wasn't necessary.
- I also thought about adding a border on clicked images for better user experience, but I didn't want to worry about margins.
